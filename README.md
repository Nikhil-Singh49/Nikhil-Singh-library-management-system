Python Assignment 3
This project is a basic console‑based Library Management System in Python that stores data in a simple text file. It defines a Book class for each book’s title, author, ISBN, and status, and a LibraryInventory class that keeps a list of books, saving and loading them line‑by‑line from books.txt. The user interacts through a menu to add new books, issue and return books, view all books, and search by title or ISBN
